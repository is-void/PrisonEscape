# PrisonEscape
-A text based puzzle game I made during sophmore year of high school

# Description
Made during my Sophomore year, the project was an escape game in which the player would look in different rooms for clues and objects that would help them escape. During the project, I learned many valuable skills and learned how to properly document my code using Javadoc.
Time commitment ~ 30 hours
The most time-consuming part of the project was trying to maintain a good structure in order to keep the project readable and expandable.
Issues and Hurdles
Originally, I attempted to use 2D arrays to store the room values, but my limited knowledge about them at the time made it difficult to actually execute. Eventually, I decided to use an array for each y value, and create a function that translates the y postion .
At the time, I didn't know how to use HashMaps, so I ran into many issues with data storage I had to creatively work around.
Reflection/Lessons Learned
While the project was enjoyable to work on, my limited knowledge of different data types made it difficult to develop the project. Still, I greatly enjoyed working on the project and may revisit it sometime in the future.
